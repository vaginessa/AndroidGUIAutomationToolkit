# Images Directory

## Overview
This directory (`imgs`) serves as a centralized storage for all images used by the AndroidGUIAutomationToolkit. These images are crucial for the automation scripts, enabling tasks such as image recognition, GUI element interaction, and verification of UI states in Android devices or emulators.

## Contents
- **Screenshots:** Images captured from the device screen that are used for reference or comparison.
- **Icons:** GUI element icons that scripts may search for on the screen.
- **Miscellaneous:** Any other images that support automation tasks, including but not limited to, button images, specific UI layouts, or error messages.

## Guidelines
- **Naming Convention:** Use descriptive names for your images, prefixed with their category (e.g., `button_submit.png`, `screen_login.jpg`).
- **Format:** Prefer PNG or JPG formats for better clarity and compatibility.
- **Updates:** When updating images, ensure to also update the corresponding references in the automation scripts.

## Contribution
If contributing new images or updating existing ones, please adhere to the guidelines mentioned above. This ensures consistency and efficiency in the automation process.
